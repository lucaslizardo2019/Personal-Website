		<p>Tough defense, competition featured at Jefferson Cup Boys Showcase
		In other U-17 Championship Division action, SoCal NPL side LA Premier FC 2000 made its first ever appearance at the Jefferson Cup, and the West Coast club had a strong defensive showing at the event. LA Premier earned two draws against a couple extremely tough opponents in its opening matches, playing Virginia State Cup champion SOCA to a 0-0 decision and tying Maryland's OBGC Rangers Blue 1-1. Lucas Lizardo, Ian Young, Spencer Harris and Mendez Andres anchored the back line, and goalkeeper Edward Youssef helped limit LA Premier's first two opponents to a combined one goal.
